# The Three Caballeros - Deep Learning project

Project for Deep Learning course by University of Helsinki, spring 2020.

## Goal of the project
The goal of the project was to train a neural network to do *multi-label image classification*. The group was given a training dataset of 20 000 images of resolution 128x128. The images were originally from a photo-sharing site and released under Creative Commons-licenses allowing sharing. The results were evaluated on a separate test set withheld from the group.

## Repository content
The most important parts of the repository are:
- [Final report of the project](documentation/final_report.md)
- [The final Jupyter notebook](notebooks/20_final_model.ipynb) containing the python code for the whole pipeline of our model. The code can also be found as plain python code in the submission folder.

Other parts of the repo:
- The [submission](submission/) folder contains our project submission as a zip file and the content as separate files
- The [documentation](documentation/) folder contains the final report, a todo-list and some other files related to the final report and evaluation of our models
- The [notebooks](notebooks/) folder contains different versions of the Jupyter Notebooks (Python 3) that we used during the project
- The [results](results/) folder contains classification reports, confusion matrices and learning curves for different models we trained and evaluated. These models are described in the final report.
- The [scripts](scripts/) folder contains the script used by the course staff to evaluate the submissions
