# TODO

## Basic setup
- [x] Dataloading
- [x] Training loop
- [ ] Batch visualization
- [ ] Accuracy calculation
- [x] Basic feedforward network
- [ ] Basic CNN
- [ ] Train/valid/test -split (Eeva-Maria)
- [ ] What to do with BW images (Eeva-Maria)
- [ ] Input data normalization (mean=0, std=1) (Eeva-Maria)
- [x] BatchNorm for FF NN (implemented id 01 -notebook)

## Some problems
- [x] Support for multi-label inputs
- [ ] Multi-label loss (might be working already?)

## Future
- [ ] Data augmentation
- [ ] What to do with imbalance of classes
- [ ] Transfer learning (probably small RESNET to start with?)

## Required for the course staff:
- [ ] Report
- [ ] Output for `test_eval.py` -script
- [ ] Ground truth for `test_eval.py` -script
